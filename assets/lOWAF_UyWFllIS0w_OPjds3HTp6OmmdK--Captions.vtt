00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.166
Forward Magazineâ€™s Forward Reviews is fantastic. This is another tool you can use. That is absolutely free for librarians.

2
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:21.932
You can get on their email list. This is one of the places that will come to you and talk to you about what's new.

3
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:28.399
And you can also get there are physical magazine,

4
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.333
which is, again, absolutely free for libraries.

5
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:41.833
They deal primarily with independent publishers, university presses and self publishers.

6
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:49.499
So, it's going to be things that you're not seeing in other review journals.

7
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.866
Speaking of reviewed journals,

8
00:00:53.866 --> 00:01:01.232
are you using reviews for discoverability or for gatekeeping?

9
00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:08.966
And really think about what you're using reviews to do.

10
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:15.666
Reviews are fantastic, especially for discoverability.

11
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:24.166
But if you're using them, to keep people out of your collection,

12
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:30.066
I would urge you to rethink that impulse.

13
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.566
Use reviews equitably.

14
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:38.232
Think about who was doing the reviewing,

15
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:43.433
who chooses what books can be reviewed,

16
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:55.833
and what books are being repeatedly reviewed, not leaving space for other items.

17
00:01:55.833 --> 00:02:02.566
There are so many things being published these days,

18
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:05.966
in many different formats.

19
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:09.832
That it can seem overwhelming.

20
00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:15.299
And reviews are one way to narrow the field.

21
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.633
It has to have a review before we'll even consider it.

22
00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:28.533
Or it has to have two reviews. Independently published items have to have more reviews.

23
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.333
I understand the impulse.

24
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:40.933
But we have to understand that not everything is chosen equitably to be reviewed.

25
00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:50.599
And when we think about it that way, not having a review can keep diversity out of your collection.

26
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.566
And that's the opposite of what we're trying to do.

27
00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.999
So, I'm not saying don't use reviews,

28
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.766
I'm saying think carefully about how we're using reviews.

29
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:08.732
Also think about who's doing the review?

30
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:15.033
And think about who exactly are you buying for?

31
00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:22.566
We place a lot of importance on reviews, professional reviews,

32
00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:30.732
a lot of professional reviews are done by librarians, which is fantastic.

33
00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:35.433
Are we purchasing for librarians?

34
00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:37.733
Not necessarily.

35
00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:41.366
So, while a review will tell us some things about the book.

36
00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:47.599
We need to keep in mind who we're purchasing for.

37
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:58.933
And to that end, we can also take a look at patron reviews in places like Goodreads or vendor sites.

38
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:01.666
They are also doing reviews.

39
00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:07.266
And those reviews are for other people in the general public,

40
00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:12.832
who are also thinking about reading that book.

41
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:17.499
So, we don't necessarily have to give them all the same weight.

42
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.200
But it is a good reminder that our professional review,

43
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.866
well great,

44
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:34.399
isn't necessarily going to tell us whether people in our community want to read the book.

45
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.266
We should be using a more balanced approach when it comes to considering reviews for purchase decisions.
