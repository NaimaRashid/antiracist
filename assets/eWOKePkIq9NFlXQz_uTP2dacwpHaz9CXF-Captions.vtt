1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.033
Now that we have purchased the material,

2
00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:15.733
how do we make sure we're giving it the best chance possible?

3
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.999
That's promotion and marketing.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.433
It's not something that's done to us by publishers. It's something we do for patrons.

5
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.233
We have to books that words.

6
00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:36.299
Don't ignore the items you just added to your collection.

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.266
You just spent this time this energy and this money buying diverse items for your collection.

8
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.432
Don't just ignore them.

9
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:56.999
Remember them for displays and lists and every other way you market your collection.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.966
Remember that books have many entry points.

11
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:07.332
It's much easier to celebrate them than we think.

12
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:12.633
This is a title By Way Of Sorrow by Robyn Gigl.

13
00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:23.999
And I'm not going to read all of that for you. But the gist is, it's a book where a senator's son was killed.

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.700
And the person who killed them is very much in a population that is easy to dismiss,

15
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.233
and easy to blame for things that that happened.

16
00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.399
She swears it was self-defense,

17
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.066
but up against the senator's son. Does that even matter?

18
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:59.399
There's lots and lots of ways to market this book.

19
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.133
Ordinarily, you're thinking legal thriller, or some kind of fraud.

20
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.999
And that's absolutely true.

21
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.866
But it's also hard book.

22
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.132
So any other title that's hard boiled,

23
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.066
you can put this on a list of that.

24
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:22.299
It's set New Jersey. If you're setting New Jersey, this is also easy to put on a list.

25
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.600
The author lives in New Jersey.

26
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.800
The legal thriller - you all know John Grisham.

27
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.500
So if you're looking for legal thrillers,

28
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.433
and you're doing a list of legal thrillers that are not John Grisham,

29
00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.766
this is one that can go on that lists - dirty crooked politicians.

30
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:44.232
This is a perennial list,

31
00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:46.866
and not just in thrillers.

32
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:55.466
This is when you can match with Game of Thrones, which also features a lot of dirty crooked politicians.

33
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.866
And the character is trans.

34
00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:03.332
So you don't have to leave this just for Pride Month.

35
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:16.166
You can add this to any list and have a title on there that features a trans character.

36
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:20.132
We get the question a lot of how not to be performative.

37
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:30.433
So one way to address that, performative would be putting a book on a list, because it has a diverse character,

38
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:35.399
or a diverse author on a list where it does not belong.

39
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.900
So if you put this on a list of cozy mysteries,

40
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.233
because it has a trans character,

41
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.933
you're being performative.

42
00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:46.333
And that's not something we want to do.

43
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:51.666
Because people who are looking for cozy mysteries are not looking for this book.

44
00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:54.199
This is not the book for them.

45
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
And it would lead to people saying,

46
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.166
I don't like that book with that trans character,

47
00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:03.532
when that's not what they don't like about the book at all.

48
00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:05.599
The book is too bloody for them.

49
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.433
It is too graphically violent.

50
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:13.866
It might have too graphic of language for them.

51
00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:16.199
That's not a book.

52
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.233
This is not a book that belongs on a cosy book list.

53
00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.666
But on a hard boiled book list.

54
00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.566
Absolutely.

55
00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:29.666
And it should be there.

56
00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:40.566
So if your patrons love, former police officers like Joe Pike, turned into private investigators, like Robert case,

57
00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:43.932
this is a fantastic and very popular series.

58
00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:51.699
If your patrons love this, we can diversify that by giving them broken places by Tracy Clark,

59
00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:02.333
which is an ex police officer, mystery series set in Chicago for Steven Matt Jones August snow series,

60
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:08.299
which is a diverse police officer turned private investigator

61
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.900
set in Detroit.

62
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:21.000
So, all set in big cities hard boiled with that humor

63
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.700
that you kind of expect in private Private Eye novels.

64
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:39.933
All direct correlations and readalikes to Robert Crease.

65
00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:46.533
And speaking of doing lists specifically for months like pride,

66
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.399
you don't have to wait until June.

67
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:59.866
To do a Pride Month list or put LGBTQ characters on any book list where they fit

68
00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:06.366
the price. If ghost has trans, inclusive, non binary author,

69
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.099
it's also about spaceships and generational ships,

70
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.733
very similar to the show's Snowpiercer.

71
00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:20.599
Some of the same issues that come up in that show come up in these books.

72
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.266
There's also echoes of antebellum south, and slavery.

73
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:33.499
All of these are different avenues into this book.

74
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:40.433
You don't necessarily have to go with the only avenue of non-binary author

75
00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.266
or trans inclusive.

76
00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:47.066
But yes, it is those things as well.

77
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:59.366
multiple avenues, multiple ways to get this book into the hands of someone who may not know that they will love it.

78
00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:02.732
generational shift stories is just one way.

79
00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:09.533
And these are all the things that match that book in this area.

80
00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:19.766
And we should be thinking of that, as well as the identity of the character, and the author.
