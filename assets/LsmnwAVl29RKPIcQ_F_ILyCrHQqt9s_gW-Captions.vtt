Welcome to Actively Anti-Racist Collection Development.

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.399
I am Robin Bradford.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:19.300
Before we get started talking about ways that we can include more diverse materials into the collection,

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.133
we need to start with a definition of what being anti-racist means.

5
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:33.733
So, this definition is taken from the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

6
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.633
"No one is born racist or anti-racist.

7
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.899
These results from the choices we make.

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.933
Being anti-racist results from a conscious decision to make frequent, consistent, equitable choices daily.

9
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:56.633
These choices require ongoing self-awareness, and self-reflection, as we move through life.

10
00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:07.733
In the absence of making anti-racist choices, we unconsciously uphold aspects of white supremacy, white dominant culture,

11
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.899
and unequal institutions and society.

12
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.166
Being racist or anti-racist is not about who you are.

13
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.432
It's about what you do."

14
00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:24.633
So, this is very much a term of action.

15
00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:29.666
Being anti-racist is different than being not racist.

16
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.132
Being not racist is fantastic.

17
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.199
But that's very much about how you feel.

18
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.900
And being anti-racist is about actions.

19
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.133
So, we hear a lot of things saying there's not a racist bone in my body.

20
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:50.233
And there's really no way for us to gauge if that is true or not.

21
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:58.799
But being anti-racist is about the actions you take that we can see on the outside.

22
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.466
That is the difference between being not racist, which is also good, and being anti-racist.
