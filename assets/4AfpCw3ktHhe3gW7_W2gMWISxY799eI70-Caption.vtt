00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
What happens if I fail in diversifying?

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:10.832
Or what happens if the diverse thing doesn't catch fire like we thought?

3
00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.966
The first thing we need to do is allow for a disconnect.

4
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:21.066
It's okay if something doesn't catch on.

5
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:26.632
And if we think about the reasons why something may not catch on,

6
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:33.899
it isn't always about the diversity of the thing.

7
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.966
Promised Land may have been a fantastic show at the wrong time.

8
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.332
The 1980s were a very different time.

9
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:52.899
There was lots of competition in the nighttime soap opera.

10
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.833
So maybe that was the soap for its time.

11
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.166
There was a lot less competition.

12
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.199
However, across all the media,

13
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.533
you didn't have streaming in the 1980s,

14
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:15.899
you didn't have the plethora of TV shows that we have now.

15
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.033
So maybe it wasn't because the cast was Latin,

16
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.966
or the cultural background was Latin.

17
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:29.499
It could be that Falcon Crest had a lot fewer things to compete against

18
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.733
than Promised Land did in the 21st century.

19
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.333
People may still want to hear those stories.

20
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:42.833
But it didn't catch on.

21
00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:56.733
It didn't grab the attention as it may have done if it was competing on the same playing field as the 1980 show.

22
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:01.066
The next thing we need to do is let the unsuccessful thing stand on its own

23
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.432
and realize that show didn't catch on.

24
00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:10.299
That doesn't mean any other show with a Latin cast won't catch on.

25
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.633
Don't impute failure to everything that might share ethnic or cultural similarities.

26
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:28.433
That's all they share. So, a stage drama with a primarily Latin cast may blow up entirely on its own,

27
00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:34.099
independent of what happened with the story about wine country.

28
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.333
It's not the fact that the cast shares a cultural background,

29
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:46.933
or the same ethnicity, or race, or gender, or anything.

30
00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:53.166
It was that one show or book, that didn't happen to catch fire.

31
00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.466
It happens.

32
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:59.966
But what we can't do is decide,

33
00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:06.099
because that one thing didn't catch on.

34
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.300
We won't buy anything else that shares the same ethnicity or cultural similarity.
