00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.766
A collection development policy is a thing we think everyone should have.

2
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:12.932
And the likelihood is, in 2022, you probably do have one.

3
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:23.999
The other likelihood is that it may not have been updated or revised in many years.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.133
So, what is it?

5
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:35.833
A collection development policy is a tool that tells people outside of your department

6
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.966
or your institution

7
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:45.199
how you go about creating and maintaining your collection.

8
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.000
It's a broad overview.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.733
So, it doesn't necessarily have to get down to the nitty-gritty of every single title in your collection.

10
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.666
It's a broad overview.

11
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:04.366
And it's written for everyone's consumption.

12
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.332
So, it's not just for other librarians.

13
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.299
It's not just for other library staff.

14
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.866
It can be for the general public.

15
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:21.399
It can be for anyone who is interested in your collection.

16
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.266
And why you need one is because people are increasingly interested

17
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.399
in how collections are created and maintained.

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.866
We want to be sure that instead of creating a vacuum,

19
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:42.599
where people can make their own determinations

20
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.333
about what we're thinking and what our criteria are,

21
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.999
we have a document that we can point to,

22
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.733
to say - this is what we were thinking; these are our criteria.

23
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:01.633
But it doesn't just need to be that formal policy.

24
00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:08.933
Informally, you can have procedures, either for other people in your department,

25
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:13.266
for other people in your library or even just for yourself.

26
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.732
So that you know on a more individualized basis

27
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:23.533
could be broken down by category,

28
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:26.466
by age group,

29
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:31.199
how you go about creating your collection.

30
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:40.933
So, this is more procedures. If people want to know - how you evaluate material rules

31
00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.799
to determine if they go into young adult

32
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.433
or adult or young adult or juvenile.

33
00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:51.699
That's informal collection development

34
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.200
procedure that you can have in your library.

35
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:09.466
Just in case, you're not there, one day, or one month, or if you leave, and people want to know how to step in and continue the work,

36
00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:15.066
and formal procedures will work for that.

37
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:22.199
Both are good to have. But the formal collection development policy is a necessity.
