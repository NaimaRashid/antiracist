00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
How do we actually find material?

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:11.366
One of the best places to look for material is in Edelweiss.

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:17.432
And I know you're thinking - Wait, that's a place where I go to get review copies?

4
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.933
Yes, it is.

5
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.799
It is great for that purpose.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:30.666
It's also great for taking a look at very, very big pot of books,

7
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:39.499
such as everything being published, and narrowing it down in your specific area.

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.566
I highly recommend using this method.

9
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:50.232
As you can see, they allow you to have filters.

10
00:00:50.233 --> 00:01:01.666
So yes, you can go in and look through everything. I think you'll be surprised at how much everything actually is. There is a lot.

11
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:13.766
But you can begin to narrow it down by vendor by imprint, publication date subject, Dewey Lexile level, age, format,

12
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:18.466
whether it has a review, copy,

13
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.399
lots of ways to narrow it down.

14
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.633
One of the ways that I often employ

15
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:31.466
is looking at updates.

16
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:35.699
So, you can do it by month, you can do it every four months.

17
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
You can do it by year.

18
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.066
If you have a very small area like algebra books,

19
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.299
you might not want to do that monthly.

20
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.266
There may not be algebra books out monthly.

21
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:54.799
It may be okay to do that every six months or every year.

22
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.100
If you're doing something like fiction,

23
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.133
and you go a full year,

24
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.933
you will have an unwieldy list of materials.

25
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:11.166
So, I would suggest taking it by genre,

26
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:16.099
or taking it by pub date,

27
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.466
and just going month to month,

28
00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:27.032
until you figure out if that amount of material is useful.

29
00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:31.499
Or you can just look for your own curiosity.

30
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.800
Starting today, looking at one month in these areas that are personally interesting to me,

31
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400
what is going to be coming out

32
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.666
and you see the result is 2855 items.

33
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:54.566
So unwieldy if you have multiple things to look at.

34
00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:59.332
Or if it's compared to something like fiction,

35
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:05.199
this number might look pretty good.

36
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.533
So, if you're looking for something a little smaller,

37
00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:15.733
you see you can narrow it down as small as you like.

38
00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:20.433
So, starting today, looking out for months,

39
00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.933
we're going to do not all eviction,

40
00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:26.066
but just a little bit,

41
00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:37.332
just mystery and crime, which could include mystery detective, or thrillers, psychological or legal crime or nor.

42
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:42.133
We're going to check all the formats because I still to this day,

43
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:45.433
don't know the difference between hardback and hardcover.

44
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.166
It's the same thing. But just in case, there's a difference.

45
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.466
We're going to do both.

46
00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:55.032
And we're going to focus on adult.

47
00:03:55.033 --> 00:04:01.033
And you see that came up with 1072 items for four months.

48
00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.966
Very, very doable.

49
00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:14.699
And not to leave out the other place that you get advanced reader copies.

50
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.333
Net Galley is also good, but not quite as robust a search function as Edelweiss.

51
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:29.499
But this is telling you things that are upcoming.

52
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.233
They have a very good focus,

53
00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:35.966
especially on individual and self published items.

54
00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:42.199
So, if you're looking for that, Net Galley is a good place to start.

55
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.933
You have categories for LGBTQ IA and also multicultural.

56
00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:57.166
And it's a great place to not only get advanced reader copies,

57
00:04:57.166 --> 00:05:03.499
you absolutely do not have to download every arc that you see.

58
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.966
But it's going to help you with discoverability.

59
00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:16.232
These are three things I discovered just doing a search looking for new materials.

60
00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:30.466
It was very interesting to see how many of these were reviewed or even mentioned in other vendor catalogs or review journals.

61
00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:33.099
The answer is - not too many!
