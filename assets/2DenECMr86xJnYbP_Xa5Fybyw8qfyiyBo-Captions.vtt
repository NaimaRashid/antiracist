00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.366
One of the best things we can do is decolonize. Our thinking around who is allowed to write what diverse books.

2
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:21.432
Don't limit yourself or your diverse books to subjects you think diverse people should be experts in.

3
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:28.666
Promote for the subject of the book, the way you want to promote for author identity.

4
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:39.866
We reach for author identity, because it's easier for us, but promote for the subject of the book, the same way you promote for author identity.

5
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:48.999
And this doesn't mean that you stop buying books about racism or sociology, civil rights in our BIPOC history.

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.166
It absolutely does not mean that.

7
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.932
This isn't an 'either or' proposition.

8
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.933
It's a both 'and' proposition.

9
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:05.233
We have absolutely still need books like caste, and how to raise an anti-racist.

10
00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.599
We absolutely still need.

11
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.833
But we also need to realize that people of color, diverse people can also be experts in physics.

12
00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.799
Absolutely.

13
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.333
In personal finance,

14
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.999
Yes.

15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.400
In sewing and textiles,

16
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.366
Adventure.

17
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:34.366
In yoga.

18
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:42.432
We can be experts in all the things.

19
00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:46.766
What's next is to read, reading widely is super beneficial.

20
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.466
Not just to you personally,

21
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:57.832
but also, in how you help people who come to you asking for new things to read.

22
00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:01.699
Reading widely is very beneficial.

23
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.233
And if you don't have time for that,

24
00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:08.199
because although people think we sit around and read all day,

25
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.033
we know that's not true.

26
00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.633
Read more things about books.

27
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.066
Get involved in the book atmosphere.

28
00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:19.266
Because there you're going to learn about what's new.

29
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.266
You're going to see what's trending.

30
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.799
You're going to see who's making what deals.

31
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.300
You're going to know what's coming to a TV near you.

32
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.733
What's coming to a movie theater near you.

33
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:36.399
And how you can promote for those things in your library.

34
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.100
Because you are the valuable commodity in this puzzle.

35
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.200
Books may be the picture but your skills and knowledge are the free.

36
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.266
Without you, none of this works on any level.

37
00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.432
No level.

38
00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.499
Diverse Books have existed for years.

39
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.033
You are the bridge that gets them into patronage.

40
00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:17.166
So the NoveList lesson - Collection diversity benefits everyone in the community,

41
00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:23.899
no matter what their racial or cultural background happens to be.

42
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.900
And you are now ready to proceed to Lesson Two.
