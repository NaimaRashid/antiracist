00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.833
Diversifying our collection means we're bringing old stories to new life.

2
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:19.966
And the first slide, if you don't know, is a 1980s soap opera called Falcon Crest.

3
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:25.432
It was very much about the wealth in excess of wine country.

4
00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:33.266
It was right along with Dallas and Dynasty and all the ones that you may either remember,

5
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.999
or you've heard.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.433
And currently, there was a show called Promised Land,

7
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:48.499
which is very much about the wealth in excess of a country

8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.800
in the 21st century with a primarily Latin cast.

9
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.266
So old stories, welcome access,

10
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.532
in wine country, given new life,

11
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:10.066
with a new perspective, from a new cultural background.

12
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:15.732
As we're doing this, I can tell you that Promised Land

13
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:20.499
was canceled after the First Season.

14
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.833
So, when we think about that, in terms of books,

15
00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:30.799
when something doesn't hit with an audience,

16
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.266
the first thing we reach for is people who don't want to read about those people.

17
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.399
And we need to rethink that instinct.
