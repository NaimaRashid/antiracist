Discoverability - How we find the things that we want to add to our collection?

2
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.432
How are you finding materials?

3
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.166
Are you only looking at what is shown to you?

4
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:24.866
So, what you're getting through emails from publishers?

5
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.199
Or what you're seeing in review catalogs?

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.033
How are you finding materials?

7
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:41.933
Do you go out looking for other items?

8
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:53.733
Here are some great places for discoverability of materials, of diverse materials, in particular.

9
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:58.533
So, you have Melanin in YA.

10
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.533
Or this, We Need Diverse Books site.

11
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.666
LGBTQ reads.

12
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.499
Your #RomanceClass, and Crime Writers of Color.

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.033
All great places for you to start the discoverability process.

14
00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:23.166
Many of these things will be shown in reviewed journals,

15
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.466
or in Publisher Catalogs.

16
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:31.632
But not all, there's a limited amount of space in all of those places.

17
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:38.266
The onus is on us to be curious, to go back to the ground rules,

18
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:44.899
and learn about what is out there for us to show to our patrons.
