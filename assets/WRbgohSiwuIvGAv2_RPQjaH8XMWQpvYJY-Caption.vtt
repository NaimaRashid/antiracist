00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.266
How do we turn that collection philosophy into practice?

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:17.299
Or what are the mechanics of diversifying our collection?

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.633
Before we start talking about that, let's talk about some general collection development ground rules.

4
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:31.399
The first ground rule that is true in every case,

5
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.133
you will never be caught up.

6
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:38.766
Make peace with that now. You will never be caught up.

7
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.766
If you think you are getting caught up,

8
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:46.566
there will be another Tuesday with all the new books.

9
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.932
And these days,

10
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:53.633
that also was another Wednesday or another Friday,

11
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:57.933
because books aren't released just on one day a week anymore.

12
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.166
So, with all of that in coming at you,

13
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.266
you will never be caught up.

14
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.466
And it's okay.

15
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.999
You must be curious.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.233
Collection development is a job of curiosity.

17
00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:20.433
You're always looking for the next thing that will catch fire with your patrons.

18
00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:24.866
And you have so many different kinds of patrons,

19
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.599
that you're looking for different things for different people.

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.900
You must be curious and get out there and look for things.

21
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.733
You must be adaptable.

22
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.633
People think libraries move slowly.

23
00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:47.299
But this is an area that moves very quickly.

24
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.966
In terms of what's available, in terms of how we make it available.

25
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:59.899
In terms of format, from digital to physical, from streaming,

26
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.200
you must be adaptable.

27
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.233
Because things that we're purchasing or trying to purchase

28
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:12.199
or wanting to purchase are changing very quickly.

29
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.233
We need to keep up.

30
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:19.499
You will make mistakes. It will happen.

31
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.800
This is an absolute truth. Much like, you will never be caught up.

32
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.066
When you're dealing with the volume of material that you tend to deal with in collection development,

33
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.699
you will make mistakes.

34
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.833
And again, like not ever being caught up. It's okay.

35
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:45.199
The best thing about making mistakes is you'll never make the same mistake twice.

36
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.566
It won't get done. Unless you do it.

37
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:55.099
You'll never be caught up. But it won't get done unless you do it.

38
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.133
Because your job is to open the floodgates, not to be a gatekeeper.

39
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:09.866
Our job is to show our patrons all the things that they know about and all the things that they didn't know they wanted until

40
00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:15.399
they came and saw it on our shelves or in our catalogs.
