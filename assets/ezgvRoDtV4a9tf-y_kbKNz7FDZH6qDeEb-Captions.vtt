00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.433
Once you've run your discoverability checks,

2
00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:09.166
and you've picked out what you want to buy,

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.832
we have to actually buy.

4
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:21.033
And sometimes finding where to purchase something is its own adventure.

5
00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:31.199
Here we have the new overnight sensation. Talia Hibbert, who had a hit, as you can see a USA Today bestseller,

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.133
a New York Times bestseller,

7
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.566
with this series that came out last year.

8
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.099
Fantastic.

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.433
Everyone loved it. And they wanted more, more and more.

10
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:52.233
And the good news for them is that Talia Hibbert was not a new overnight sensation at all.

11
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:59.399
She is an overnight sensation, after publishing quite a few titles.

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.200
So, she wasn't very much new to a larger audience,

13
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.933
but not new to publishing.

14
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:17.766
And there were other titles, she came with a complete backlist that we could give to our patrons to satisfy the need

15
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:23.099
that came from having a wider audience.

16
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.366
The first thing we do is, you know, you can buy them digitally.

17
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.966
And that's pretty easy to discover.

18
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:38.666
But we also want to provide print copies, for not everybody has digital access,

19
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:43.232
not everybody wants to read digitally.

20
00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:49.899
So, we want to provide access in other ways.

21
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.133
So, we know it exists.

22
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:56.966
But we can't seem to find it.

23
00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:00.166
This is one vendor.

24
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:06.032
They have all different kinds of formats, except for the one we actually want.

25
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:11.466
So, you start to think, is it available in print?

26
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:16.199
Well, yes, I can buy it as a consumer.

27
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.966
There it is,

28
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:23.166
I can also buy it from my library from a consumer site.

29
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:34.166
But it's a lot easier, especially for our processes to buy it from a vendor that we work with, on a regular basis.

30
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:39.599
So, we go to, and there it is, in the format that we want.

31
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.133
The moral of the story is, don't rely on a single vendor,

32
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:49.099
especially if you can't find an item.

33
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.700
Look in multiple vendors.

34
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.800
And yes, it is more work.

35
00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.100
But ultimately, you're going to find the thing that will make your patrons appreciative.

36
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.800
If we do that little bit of extra searching.

37
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.500
This isn't always the case, sometimes it's not available from any library event.

38
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:21.733
But there are vendors who are more friendly to indie publishing, and self publishing authors who may start in digital

39
00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:26.533
and then create print copies because they see the demand.

40
00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.933
Some vendors are more friendly to that than others.

41
00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:37.799
If you do business with only one vendor, I would urge you to reconsider that.

42
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.700
So that you have more options for getting material into your collection.
