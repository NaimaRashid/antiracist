00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.233
When we talk about why we need diverse materials,

2
00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.166
we think about Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop,

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:17.132
and her analogy of windows, mirrors, and sliding glass doors.

4
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.333
Books are sometimes windows.

5
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:24.466
Offering views of worlds that may be real or imagined, familiar or strange.

6
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.932
These windows are also sliding glass doors.

7
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:38.466
And readers have only to walk through imagination to become part of whatever world has been created and recreated by the author.

8
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:44.966
When lighting conditions are just right, however, a window can also be a mirror.

9
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:50.199
Literature transformed human experience and reflects it back to us.

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.966
And in that reflection, we can see our own lives and experiences as part of the larger human experience.

11
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:07.999
And this is absolutely true. It's been true for a long time and will probably continue to be true.

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.766
Yes, people deserve to see themselves on the shelf.

13
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.032
Absolutely.

14
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:21.799
And differences in what you're reading to who you are, lead to learning,

15
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.433
which is also a very good thing.

16
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:30.533
Books can be a window and a mirror to the same person,

17
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:34.199
because books have many entry points.

18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.333
And not all of them are going to fit every individual.

19
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.299
But also, diverse books are for everyone.

20
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.866
We talk a lot about, we need to diversify our collections because we have this percentage of non white,

21
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:59.866
non straight other cultural backgrounds in our community.

22
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.699
And that is true.

23
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.333
Everyone deserves to see themselves on the shelf.

24
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.066
But diverse books are for everyone,

25
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:10.999
not just for who you see reflected in your community.

26
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.866
And just because your experience is not centered, doesn't mean it's not for you.

27
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.866
Let me say that one more time.

28
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:25.732
Just because your experience is not centered,

29
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.233
doesn't mean it's not for you,

30
00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:32.733
because diverse books are for everyone.

31
00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.766
And it's not obligated to teach.

32
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:41.499
Unless it's a book that is about information that you can learn.

33
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.166
But it's also obligated to entertain.

34
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:51.166
And sometimes a diverse title is written just for that purpose, to entertain.

35
00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:57.266
And it doesn't have to center your experience for you to enjoy it.

36
00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:02.799
Because diverse books are for everyone.

37
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.266
So listen and think about who is voice?

38
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.266
Are we missing in our collections?

39
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.266
Who are we not seeing?

40
00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:18.832
And sometimes it's hard to think about that because you're not seeing them.

41
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:27.399
But when the opportunity arises and you notice a gap in the collection,

42
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.366
that's a time for you to not just fill that particular gap,

43
00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:34.932
but look to see how far that extends?

44
00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:39.599
Whose voice voices are we missing?

45
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.800
How do I increase those voices?

46
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.966
Is it a matter of just buying more materials?

47
00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:58.599
Or is it a matter of buying those materials and making sure we're making the connections as to how those will be best used for everyone?

48
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.533
Is there a current solution?

49
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.166
Sometimes there isn't.

50
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:13.199
One of my favorite questions is how do we diversify our Amish romances

51
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.666
at the current time? Amish romances are not diverse?

52
00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:20.266
Does that mean we stop buying them? Of course not.

53
00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:30.232
It means that we recognize this is an area that needs some work in that area.

54
00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:33.233
It isn't out there to purchase now.

55
00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:36.366
But we keep this issue in mind.

56
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:39.199
So we're constantly looking.

57
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.300
When we're looking for Amish Romances.

58
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.833
We're looking to see if there has been a change.

59
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:54.966
We're also looking to see maybe not Amish Romances, but religious fiction.

60
00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:58.132
Can I diversify in that way?

61
00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.866
So it is exactly apples to apples.

62
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.732
But it's an issue we're keeping in mind.

63
00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:10.566
And we're looking for other ways to diversify in the meantime.
