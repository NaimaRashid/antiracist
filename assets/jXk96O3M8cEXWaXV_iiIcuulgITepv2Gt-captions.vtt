00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.133
You must go look for the books.

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:11.566
Realize that sometimes the best sites go away.

3
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:25.632
So, it's a constant journey to those sites to make sure they are updated and still there.

4
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:31.966
Because when one goes away, another will pop up in its place.

5
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:38.232
So, you're always on the lookout for the next best place.

6
00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:46.933
That's going to show you what's new in your chosen genre or subject that you're looking for.

7
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:53.099
So, there's the constant search, because you will never be caught up.

8
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.066
And you must be curious.

9
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.599
So, you're constantly searching.

10
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.200
Even traditional publishers have seasons.

11
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.300
So, there's always the next best thing that you want to add to your collection.

12
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.966
But there's help.

13
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:19.332
And you can absolutely use the tools that you already have.

14
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.266
Recognize that vendors want your money.

15
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:29.032
And they want you to spend that money with them as much as possible.

16
00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.933
So let them help you help yourself.

17
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:38.999
This is a list from Ingram. Diverse Romance and Erotica.

18
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200
You'll see that there are some older books,

19
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.533
and some brand new books

20
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:49.166
and 159 products.

21
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:55.399
It's not going to completely remake your Romance section.

22
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.500
But there will be some things in this list that you can check to see if you have them.

23
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.666
And if you don't, you can decide if these would be good for your collection.

24
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:14.032
Not every book needs to be in every collection.

25
00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.966
But it's a good place to start.

26
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:23.032
If you're looking to diversify your Romance section.

27
00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.866
Baker and Taylor has a similar tool.

28
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:38.366
And they have theirs for Adult and for Juvenile. This is not necessarily dedicated to a certain genre.

29
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:45.432
And there are several you can go through and look through each these are changed frequently

30
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.533
in conjunction with carcass.

31
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:56.166
Sometimes the lists aren't as long or robust as we would wish them to be

32
00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.366
which is why it's a it's an ongoing process.

33
00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:05.299
It's why you have to do it continuously to see what's been updated,

34
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.400
what's been added,

35
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.600
what's been taken away how it's been changed.

36
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.100
What I like most about this is that they have several different categories

37
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.133
and several different subcategories within those categories.

38
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:27.066
So you can be as general or as specific as you need to be at the time.
